/**
 * Used for communication between objects that have no reference to each other.
 *
 * Any classes that wish to listen to events (not {@link Event}s) must register itself by calling
 * {@link EventBus#register(Object)}, and call {@link EventBus#unregister(Object)} on {@link #DEFAULT}
 * before it is garbage collected to avoid memory leaks. To listen to events, write methods as so:
 *
 * <code>
 *     \@Subscribe
 *     public void methodName(EventToListenTo e){}
 * </code>
 *
 * Since methods are recognized based on the type of their parameter, each event must have a unique
 * parameter type. For every new event, create the parameter type as a class below. Give the class
 * a {@code public final} variable if the event should transmit data.
 *
 * See more documentation <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained">here</a>.
